Commensality, the act of eating together, offers a rich multisensory and social experience that can be enhanced through technology. Dining involves interactions with food, where smells, colors, sounds, and textures contribute to a multisensory experience and the table becomes a focal point for social interaction, with nonverbal cues and conversations being indispensable elements of commensal experience.

This workshop aims to explore how interactive technology can enrich dining experiences. The other aim is to build an interdisciplinary community around the topics of related to commensality and human-food interaction, with special focus on the role of multimodal interaction among commensal partners sharing food, being humans or artificial dining companions (such as social robots). We aim to collect novel contributions that explore how interactive technology can enhance, facilitate, or make these experiences more enjoyable.

## Submission instructions

We encourage the submission of original contributions, investigating novel methodologies to build creative systems and algorithms for commensality and HFI. The call is open for both complete and ongoing works, research ideas and the position papers, especially interdisciplinary contributions in line with the main goals of the workshop.  In particular, authors can submit:

- Long papers (max. 7 pages + references – ACM format);

- Short/Position/Discussion papers (max 4 pages + references – ACM format);

Submission Site <https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cofi2024>

All submitted papers will be evaluated by at least two members of the program committee, based on originality, significance, relevance, and technical quality. Submissions should be single blinded, i.e. authors names should be included in the submissions. At least one of the authors should register and take part at the workshop to make the presentation. 

Papers can be short (4 pages + bibliography) or long (7 pages + bibliography) either in ACM sigconf Latex or Word format <https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions>:

- latex <https://portalparts.acm.org/hippo/latex_templates/acmart-primary.zip>
